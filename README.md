### Option 1: Streamlit Web App (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepfake-detection.git
   cd deepfake-detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the web app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:8501`

### Option 2: Google Colab

1. Upload `deepfake_detection_colab.ipynb` to Google Colab
2. Run all cells to install dependencies and initialize the system
3. Use the provided functions to analyze videos

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Memory**: Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: At least 2GB free space
- **GPU**: CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, for faster processing)

### Dependencies Installation

1. **Create virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install PyTorch** (choose your platform)
   ```bash
   # CPU only
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   
   # CUDA 11.8
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   
   # CUDA 12.1
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
   ```

3. **Install other dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Docker Installation (Alternative)

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t deepfake-detection .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8501:8501 deepfake-detection
```

## üìñ Usage

### Web Application

1. **Start the Streamlit app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Upload a video** using the file uploader
3. **Adjust settings** in the sidebar (optional)
4. **Click "Analyze Video"** to start detection
5. **View results** with confidence scores and visualizations

### Google Colab

Open `deepfake_detection_colab.ipynb` in Google Colab and follow the notebook instructions.

## üéØ How It Works

### 1. **Face Detection**
- Uses OpenCV Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces in video frames
- Extracts face regions with padding for better analysis
- Supports multiple faces per frame

### 2. **Preprocessing**
- Resizes detected faces to 224x224 pixels
- Applies normalization using ImageNet statistics
- Converts to PyTorch tensors for model input

### 3. **Deep Learning Model**
- **Backbone**: EfficientNet-B0 for feature extraction
- **Architecture**: Custom classifier with dropout layers
- **Output**: Binary classification (Real vs Fake)
- **Activation**: Softmax for probability scores

### 4. **Post-processing**
- Aggregates predictions across all detected faces
- Calculates confidence scores and statistics
- Applies threshold-based classification

## üìä Performance Metrics

The system provides several metrics to evaluate detection quality:

- **Average Probability**: Mean fake probability across all faces
- **Confidence Score**: System confidence in the prediction
- **Face Count**: Number of faces analyzed
- **Classification Accuracy**: Percentage above/below threshold
- **Temporal Consistency**: Variation in predictions over time


### Analysis Results
- Interactive charts showing prediction timeline
- Statistical summaries with confidence scores
- Classification breakdown (Real vs Fake)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Model Limitations

- **Demo Model**: Current implementation uses randomly initialized weights for demonstration
- **Training Data**: For production use, train on datasets like DFDC or FaceForensics++
- **Accuracy**: Detection accuracy depends on video quality and face visibility
- **Performance**: Processing time varies with video length and hardware

### Ethical Considerations

- **Privacy**: Ensure you have permission to analyze uploaded videos
- **Bias**: Be aware of potential biases in training data
- **Misuse**: This tool should be used responsibly and ethically
- **Legal**: Comply with local laws regarding deepfake detection

### Security

- **Data Handling**: Uploaded videos are processed locally and not stored permanently
- **Model Security**: Use trusted model weights and validate inputs
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated for security patches
